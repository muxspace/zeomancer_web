  heading: Why weather stations?
  text: "Farmers comprise more than 70% of the population of Africa and subsist on the food they grow. These farmers have no access to weather forecasts and are at the mercy of the heavens. That results in crop losses of 30% or more per year. Access to reliable, hyperlocal weather forecasts does more than help farmers adapt to climate change. They also increase food security and help alleviate poverty."
