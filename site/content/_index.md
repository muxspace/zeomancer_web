  heading: Why weather stations?
  #text: "Farmers comprise more than 60% of the population of Africa. Many farmers face chronic hunger due to the 40% of their crop lost to bad weather and climate change. Weather forecasts give farmers the data they need to protect their crops and increase their food security. Our weather stations power personalized weather forecasts for every farmer to combat hunger."
  list: 
  - Farmers comprise more than 60% of the population of Africa.
  - While we take weather forecasts for granted, African farmers have no access to weather forecasts.
  - Many farmers face chronic hunger due to the 40% of their crop lost to bad weather and climate change.
  - Weather forecasts give farmers the data they need to protect their crops and increase their food security.
  - Our weather stations power personalized weather forecasts for every farmer to combat hunger.
  - These devices can also collect soil data to further improve crop yields, helping farmers break free from poverty.
